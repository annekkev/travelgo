# Description
TravelGO! was created by four computer science students during their study abroad in Vienna Austria. This travel app was created to enhance tourists travels in Vienna. We came up with this idea because Professor Pettit encourages free time, but we aren't always sure how best to spend our time in this new and exciting city. As a result of these dilemmas, we created TravelGO! so tourists visiting Vienna can maximize their time and ensure they have a good, unique visit. TravelGo lets users personalize their day to day activities and creates a fun interactive user expereience while exposing vistors to hidden gems in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria!
